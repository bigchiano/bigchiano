# Chris Ochuko

Full-stack Web3 developer. 7+ years shipping software, 5+ in blockchain.

I build cross-chain bridges, DeFi protocols, and production dApps across Solana, Base, and EVM chains. I've led small teams, deployed contracts handling real money, and built systems serving 40k+ concurrent users.

### Things I've shipped

- A production cross-chain bridge (Solana / EVM) with native coin support and white-label deployment
- A P2P lending protocol on Base with Chainlink oracles and a liquidation engine
- A full DeFi ecosystem — DEX, staking, stablecoin, on-chain random oracle — leading a team of 5
- Custom subgraphs indexing trades across Ethereum DEXs
- A blockchain from scratch using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint
